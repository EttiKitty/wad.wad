# wad.wad
GO TO THE LATEST RELEASE!!

Since this is a monthly release and I don't want to hand out a pre-release,
I find it easier to release it all on the first of the month.
#   
wad.wad is the name for this wad that I'm making.
Originally a placeholder, now it's the actual name.

I am fairly confident that you won't need DOOM II to run if using prBoom+, unsure about any other source port.

If any errors occur, please get in touch with me!!
