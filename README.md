# wad.wad

__This project is *indefinitely* put on hold, I will *NOT* be releasing anything on its anniversary__

I haven't had much of any motivation to do anything else to the mod

wad.wad is the name for this wad that I'm making.
Originally a placeholder, now it's the actual name.

You do need DOOM II to run. Since every source port requires it.
